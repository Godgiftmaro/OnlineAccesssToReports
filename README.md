PROBLEM STATEMENT: The academic condition on government level is very critical issue in Pakistan, especially in KPK. There is no proper platform by which parents can be kept up to date with the progress of their children in schools. Progress involves the attendance and results of the students.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: We’ve developed an open source prototype of Electronic Access to School Records for all the Govt. Schools of KPK where parents and teacher can communicate about the progress of student/children.

PROJECT SOLUTION: We’re proposed 2 solutions for the electronic access. 1) Web Based Access 2) SMS Based Access
